ngredients:

1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
3/4 cup granulated sugar
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups chocolate chips (semi-sweet or milk chocolate)
Instructions:

Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy.

Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.

In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt.

Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing just until combined. Be careful not to overmix.

Fold in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the cookie dough.

Drop rounded tablespoons of cookie dough onto ungreased baking sheets, leaving enough space between each cookie.

Bake in the preheated oven for 9 to 11 minutes or until the edges are golden brown. Keep an eye on them, as baking times may vary depending on your oven.

Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to wire racks tredundant
